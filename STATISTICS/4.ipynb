    "##### Q-4. A group of 20 friends decide to play a game in which they each write a number between 1 and 20 on a slip of paper and put it into a hat. They then draw one slip of paper at random. What is the probability that the number on the slip of paper is a perfect square (i.e., 1, 4, 9, or 16)?"
